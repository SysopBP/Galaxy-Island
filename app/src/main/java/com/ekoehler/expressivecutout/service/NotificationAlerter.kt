 *
 * Holding a notification back from the shade cancels it, and the framework stops whatever sound or
 * vibration is playing for a notification it cancels — so an alert that began the instant the
 * notification posted is cut off a few milliseconds later, well before it registers as anything.
 * This puts it back as the pill appears, drawn from the notification's own channel so an app still
